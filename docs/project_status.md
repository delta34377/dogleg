## 🔄 Currently Working On
- Live in production at vercel app URL
- Monitoring user engagement with discovery content

## 🟡 Built, awaiting rollout (branch claude/golf-stats-positioning-qkes3j)
- **Stats layer ("Strava for Golf" foundation)** — see `docs/stats_pivot_plan.md`
  - ✅ Database migration APPLIED to production 7/5/2026 (stats_layer +
    stats_layer_hardening in Supabase migrations; idempotent, safe to re-run)
  - ✅ 9-hole rounds earn differentials via the WHS 2024 expected-differential
    method (45 of the first 72 production rounds were 9-hole)
  - ⚠️ Remaining step: merge this branch to master → Vercel deploys the UI
  - Auto handicap index (WHS), per-round differentials, backfilled for all rounds
  - Dogleg Score (0.0–10.0) chips on every round card
  - Achievements/PR badges stamped at post time
  - New Stats tab (4th nav tab) with trends and breakdowns (Recharts)
  - Course pages with leaderboards at /courses/:courseId
  - Score entry: last-used tee preselect, handicap hint, optional putts tracking
  - Positioning/brand flip NOT included — deliberately deferred (see plan doc)

## Next Steps
- Add user discovery ("Find Golfers to Follow")
- Add following/followers functionality
- Push notifications
- Offline support (PWA)

## 🎯 Current Decisions

### 📊 Feed Algorithm Details
- **Function**: `get_feed_with_discovery` (PostgreSQL RPC)
- **Mix**: 70% following, 30% discovery
- **Discovery Sources**: 
  - Rounds from courses/clubs user has played
  - Popular rounds (high engagement)
- **Ranking**: Time-decay scoring with engagement weight
- **No user location required** - uses course locations instead
### 🔊 Feed Algorithm Details
- **Function**: `get_feed_with_discovery` (PostgreSQL RPC)
- **Mix**: Adjustable via admin panel (default 70% following, 30% discovery)
- **Discovery Sources**: 
  - Rounds from courses/clubs user has played
  - Popular rounds (adjustable thresholds via admin)
- **Ranking**: Adjustable weights via admin panel
- **Modes**: mixed, following-only, discovery-only
- **Admin Panel**: `/admin` route for algorithm tweaking

## Authentication Architecture
- **Smart Refocus Logic**: Only refreshes session when token expires within 30 seconds
- **userRef Pattern**: Prevents stale closures in event handlers
- **Robust Parsing**: Handles expires_at as both UNIX timestamp and ISO string
- **Single Guard Pattern**: ProtectedRoute is the only authentication guard
- **Event Selection**: visibilitychange + pageshow (not focus - fires too often)

## 📊 Analytics Implementation Details
- **Tech Stack**: Recharts for visualizations, Supabase RPC functions
- **Performance**: All metrics calculated via SQL, minimal frontend processing
- **Tracking Method**: Database triggers (no JavaScript tracking needed)
- **Data Retention**: All historical data preserved
- **Admin Access**: Restricted to markgreenfield1@gmail.com via RLS policies


### Navigation: 3 Tabs
- Feed, Add Round, My Rounds
- Removed Profile tab (access via username in header)

### Image Quality Settings
- <3MB: No compression
- 3-5MB: Light compression (0.95 quality)
- >5MB: Target 4.9MB (not 1.25MB)

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness
**Status: READY FOR BETA**
- All core features functional
- No blocking bugs
- Performance optimized


## Tech Notes
- Pars stored as array in database
- Using Supabase for all data storage
- Photos stored in 'round-photos' bucket
- Reactions table uses 'emoji' column
- Comments table uses 'content' column
- Using profiles table (not users) for foreign keys
- Photos in 'round-photos' bucket
- All user data properly associated via auth
- No more localStorage - everything in database
### Authentication Technical Notes
- **Token Expiry Tracking**: sessionExpRef stores expires_at, checked on refocus
- **Stale Closure Prevention**: userRef.current always has current user state
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Handles both number and string expires_at formats
- **Performance**: No unnecessary getSession() calls on quick tab switches
- **React Best Practices**: Proper useMemo dependencies, cleanup in useEffect
- **Mobile Optimization**: Visibility API + pageshow for all browser scenarios
- Notifications use last_notifications_check in profiles table
- Component key pattern for same-component navigation (UserProfile)
- Soft delete pattern with is_deleted flags (never hard delete)
- Notification dropdown: fixed positioning mobile, absolute desktop


## ❌ Blockers
- None currently

## 📝 Notes for Next Session
- Need to build React components
